Intel Hex to WAV file converter
==============================================

These tools were made to get the output of the
ASXXXX/ASLINK assembler/linker into some old
Sharp pocket computers. Most of the models
PC-12XX, PC-13XX and PC-14XX are supported.

'ihex2wav' converts to a WAV file. You can transfer
the resulting file to your pocket computer using
the tape interface connected to your sound card. 

usage: ihex2wav [-old] [-o wavfile] [ihexfile]

The '-old' parameter must be specified for some
older models of the PC-12XX series (I think PC-124X
and PC-125X).

By default there is a little loader program added to
the DATA lines. If you don't need it, use the parameter
'-nostub'. The '-compact' parameter makes ASCII DATA lines;
they need less space but the time for poking them into
the memory increases.


Building an Executeable
-----------------------

You need GNU make and a C compiler. Just make the
directory containing 'makefile' the current directory
and type 'make'.

Should work on any platform (Linux with gcc v3.2.2 or later)

  WAV files for Sharp pocket computers
